 * Custom hook to set up the game when the camera is ready.
 * 
 * - Plays the audio when the camera is ready.
 * - Dispatches an action to set the game state with the song duration.
 * - Cleans up by stopping the audio when the component unmounts or dependencies change.
 * - do not put song as dependency or website would crash
 * 
 * @param isCameraReady - Flag indicating if the camera is ready to start.
 * @param song - Object containing audio control methods (play, stop, pause) and the audio reference.
 * @param dispatch - Dispatch function to trigger Redux actions.
 * @param wholeSongDuration - Duration of the entire song to be used in the game.
